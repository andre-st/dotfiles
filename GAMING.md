## Nintendo Switch Lite (Bought 2022)

### Good 

- looks nice, good form factor (I don't like the large handheld mode size of the original switch)
- lot of games
- easy eshop ecosystem: 
	eshop cards with 10/25/50 Euro at supermarkets or Amazon to recharge credit, 
	Code-entering via switch or online, 
	active in a few seconds, 
	buying games just a few clicks
- eshop downloads cope well with network errors
- dark mode
- accessoires ecosystem
	- screen protectors
	- grips
	- protective cases (do not confuse with pockets, cases often have slits for ventilation, sound, audio jack etc which can get dirty in a bag)
	- slim vs big pockets (backpack vs car fitted luggage?)
	- (charging) stands
	- 
- gyroscope sensor (Crysis 3)
- 3,5mm Audio-Klinkensteckerbuchse
- free re-downloads after deleting or "archiving" (deletion but game icon on home-screen with "download" action)
- two volume settings: with and without headphones


### Issues

- brand image "for children"
	- many mature games now (see my list)
	- "family friendly", but many Games imho often childish aesthetics 
	  (early Nintendo aesthetics were cartoony too but resonated better than bright colors and round big-headed puppet-bodies )
	- Yakuza-devs "not cool outsiders elite platform"

- spring sounds in right analogue joystick after few days of using (new device!)
	- solved without physical disassembly:
	```	
          .-------------------.
          '-----.-------.-----'
                 \     /
                _/_____\_  <----------- 1. Lifted the small rubber dust lid with scissors, 
     #####\     /       \     /#####       there shows a hole to the inside
     ###############################    2. Added WD40 non-conductive evaporating contact(!) spray
     ##########o.o.o.o.o.o##########       (others used isopropyl alcohol, 90% has less water)
     ###########o.o.o.o.o###########    3. Gave stick a good massage
     ############o.o.o.o############    4. Repeated a second time
     ###############################
	```

- joystick drifting issue often reported (not my problem but solved same way as spring sounds)
- extra screen protector needed (tampered glas)
	- "hinge" method (thesa very weak for this)
- slow lagging eshop on switch device
	- small pagination steps, every time new request to server (devs usually try to avoid expensive I/O): 
		either bad choice 
		or very very real time prices, 
		or from times with less stressed servers 
		or regulatoy thing (eager loading prices)
		or just more complex than a central DB (similar to real-time bidding for single online-ads)
	- apparently stressed servers (website in browser on desktop-pc sometimes HTTP 500 error)
- high games prices (on every platform), but often good deals in eshop
	- the device itself is said to be a losing proposition for Nintendo, 
		and the money will then be earned from the ecosystem 
		after users have invested in the platform and are on the hook.
- no TV out
	- hardware actually missing for display-usb
- retail cartridge with "internet download required" (Wolfenstein2) 
	due to Nintendo's proprietary expensive cartridge hardware with small capacity (16 GB, 32 GB) 
	vs huge filesizes for triple a titles, future?

- small internal system space 32 GB fills quickly with eshop downloads (games became very large: Blasphemous 2d-platformer 7 GB!!), 
	needs extra MicroSD or MicroSDXC (with system update)
- changing cartridges lil bit hard but makes sense for portable system
- Nintendo support:
	- could not write replies to info@nintendo.de (SMTP error, IP block?)
	- support ticket links in answers lead to HTTP-404-pages
- adding something from Nintendo.com to wishlist will not be displayed correctly on the Nintendo.de wishlist
	(sync between device and nintendo.de works) 
- "+" and especially "-" buttons uncomfortable
- eshop downloads take long (3-4 hours for Gigabytes-Titles)
- big power adapter (but any USB source would probably do)
