## History

Couple of investments and titles that I remember I played at home, friends/cousins, youth club (&#x2B73; &#x1F4BF; &#x1F4BE;  still owned download, CD or floppy/cartridge)

## Nintendo Switch Lite

![Switch Lite](README-switch.jpg)

### Good 

- good handheld form factor
    - better than handheld mode size of the regular Switch
- weight ok
- sharp screen ("pixel density"), large enough
    - regular Switch screen is [not that much bigger](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bD1kaIrMzEk/maxresdefault.jpg), 
      the big black bezel makes the regular Switch _look_ bigger (OLED-model is actually larger);
    - so far, the screen size has not taken away from the immersion (e.g. Hellblade)
      but I already knew/guessed this from the handheld consoles of my childhood
- screen zoom feature via double pressing menu button?
- solid / sturdy / single unit body 
    - it's said that the mounted joycons of the regular Switch are [wobbling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuAcqg2VJ_Q) (although easier to change/repair), 
        regular Sw. feels cheaper ("Switch bending", "joystick connectivity issues", "loose/wobbly Joy-Con rail connection", "sharp edges/poor moulding of plastics on controllers")
- silent, device-fan not noticable
- sound with and without headphones is ok
- price okayish in 2022  (200 EUR + 70 EUR for reasonable accessories such as storage expansion)
    - although 2015 hardware and expensive (non-used) physical games; 
      _Aya Neo_ nice but triple the price, 
      _Analogue Pocket_ sexy but limited, 
      _Steam Deck_ good option but regular Switch already too large (notebook + controller?)
    - if it breaks or gets lost outside, it doesn't hurt too much
    - wouldn't buy a Nintendo Switch for TV-gaming (PS or Xbox Series S has better TCO, way better specs as weight and energy don't matter, more adult games, ...);
      down-optimized textures still look good on the Lite's 720p small screen (pixel density)
- thousands of games, AAA and indie titles, a few "smartphone games"
- easy eshop _ecosystem_
    - rechargable credit system via cards with 15/25/50/100 Euro 
    - cards available at supermarkets or Amazon (code in email)
    - Code-entering via Switch or PC and website, active in a few seconds
	- buying games just a few clicks
- eshop downloads cope well with network errors
- dark mode
- accessoires ecosystem
	- screen protectors
	- grips
	- protective cases (do not confuse with pockets, cases often have slits for ventilation, sound, audio jack etc which can get dirty in a bag)
	- protective, enlarging thumb grips (caps) for the joysticks
	- slim vs big device pockets (backpack vs car fitted luggage?)
	- game cartridges pockets
	- (charging) stands
	- extra controllers
	- alternative buttons (requires dissambly)
	- flat, small blutooth adapters
    - repair kits with spare parts (mostly inofficial, used)
	- ... 
- gyroscope sensor (gyro-aiming in Crysis 3)
- 3,5mm Audio-Klinkensteckerbuchse
- free re-downloads after deleting or "archiving" (deletion but game icon kept on home-screen with "download" action)
- two volume settings: with and without headphones
- repairable, not glued together
    - spare parts in online shops; whole donor boards where?
    - caution: ribbon/flex cable ends easy to break; look for small white flap to release the cable 
    - many YouTube tutorials
- not a tablet/smartphone
    - real controller haptics, I don't like touch screens (there are controller-addons for smartphones etc, though)
    - separate device = separate battery drain; smartphone keeps ready after gaming session   
    - optimized special purpose device, although there is a YouTube app but no Excel, cooling fan
    - healthy-escapism device vs. office everywhere
- PC or TV not occupied, can play parallel, easy to pause/resume
- streamlined simple UI 



### Issues

#### "Nintendo is for children and females" brand image:

- there are 'mature' games with deeper stories, crime and blood, 
  see my manly games list in [History section](#history); 
  USK/PEGI 18 but no "AO-rated" titles (I don't miss Switch-pr0n)
- confuses marketing to children with children-only market;
  many mature games are ports from the _manly consoles_, though
- whatever _adult_ means when it comes to video games, 
  since adults are expected to seek real adventures rather than just play (practice) them (movies/books?)
- Nintendo as platform vs Nintendo as game developer
- "family friendly", 
    - but many Games imho actually adhere to childish aesthetics 
    - early Nintendo aesthetics were cartoony too but resonated better with older ppl than the bright colors and round big-headed puppet-bodies - Chibi aesthetic - nowadays
    - I like Japan but Kawaii pop culture not so much 
    - Zelda BOTW can older and younger bc artsy/pretty
    - there are animated series and Anime that I would probably still find cool or pretty today 
      (Ghost in the Shell, Akira, MD Geist, Armitage III, Blame, Black Lagoon, Ghibli movies, Arcane, ...); 
      in Germany, drawn media are dismissed as childish, in the past more so than today, unlike in France or, of course, in Japan
- two types of "cute" games: girls’ games and children’s games
- male adult bearded Switch-Youtubers in children's rooms, 
  surrounded by little dolls (amiibo) and stuffed Nintendo-merch animals 
- Yakuza-devs: "not cool outsiders night-creatures elite platform"
- subreddit _r/tomorrow_ toxic but has a point


#### Hardware Issues:

- "spring noise"
    - in my right analogue joystick after few days of using (new device!)
	- temporarily/regularly solved without physical disassembly:
	```	
          .-------------------.
          '-----.-------.-----'
                 \     /
                _/_____\_  <----------- 1. Lifted the small rubber dust lid with scissors, 
     #####\     /       \     /#####       there shows a hole(?) to the inside
     ###############################    2. Added WD40 non-conductive evaporating contact(!) spray
     ##########o.o.o.o.o.o##########       (others used isopropyl alcohol, 90% has less water)
     ###########o.o.o.o.o###########    3. Gave stick a good massage
     ############o.o.o.o############    4. Repeated a second time
     ###############################
	```
	[YouTube-Video by WD40 company itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I35647lHFzA)
- "joystick drift"
    - often reported, not yet my problem
    - likely causes: 
        - "normal" wear and tear of the inner graphite pads; "They're not built to last"
        - [dust / dirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/cfqp0a/for_joycon_drift_it_doesnt_make_any_sense_for_the/) (solved the same way as spring noise but might remove grease too) 
        - dust in-between moving parts accelerating wear like sand-paper
    - joysticks replaceable (~15-35 euro), leave all other cables connected except for the controller flat cable
    - "Nintendo wins a class action lawsuit about joy-con drift brought by parents 
        who accused the company of knowingly selling faulty products 
        [... N. won] due to the Switch's end user license agreement which prevents lawsuits. 
        [... In] the past, Nintendo has faced many [other lawsuits](https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-lawsuits-nintendo-is-facing-over-joy-con-drift)
        over the same issue" (2023)
    - manufacturer "Alps"
    - "pot vs sensor"
        - potentiometer joysticks ([metal wipers](https://i.imgur.com/xTdYbzw.jpg) move accross [carbon-graphite resistive pads](https://i.imgur.com/Nh7MGK0.jpg), 
            changing resistance levels and altering the recorded voltage)  
        - vs _Hall-effect_ sensors (magnets and a conductor, no wear from physical contact with the sensor, SEGA Saturn 1996, Dreamcast 1999),
            GULIkit offers a joystick replacement kit
        - vs optical sensors
        - many controllers have pots but Nintendo managed to get the worst (cheap offering price and planned obsolescence?):
          "Microsoft and [Sony hardware](https://de.ifixit.com/News/48944/heres-why-ps5-joysticks-drift-and-why-theyll-only-get-worse) 
            has always had problems (RROD?), but [...] weren’t ever as universally severe as the joycon drift issue has been"
- "game card could not be read" 
    - not yet my problem
    - "headphones trick" (shares PCB with card-reader, powering headphones sometimes changes sth. for the better)
    - no contact due to 'bent pin(s)' in the card reader, repositioning via scissors or 'pin needle' 
    (might have to disasemble switch before for easier access, pins should stand pretty high)
    ```
                       ######################
                       ######################

                       ######################
    ```
    - card reader replaceable (~30 euro)
- no TV out
	- hardware actually missing for display-USB (see YouTube teardown and dissambly videos)
- small internal system's permanent memory 32 GB 
	- fills quickly with eshop downloads, many games are huge 
      (640 MB for Akane??, Blasphemous 2d-platformer 7 GB!!, Crysis 3 uses 11 GB and Hellblade 18 GB)
	- needs extra MicroSD or MicroSDXC (with system Internet-update)
- changing cartridges lil bit hard but dust/dirt/loss-protection cap makes sense for a portable system
- power adapter 
    - big 
    - "[The Brick-Gate issue](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24651915)": 
        Switch might be [not properly](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/heres-why-nintendo-switch-consoles-keep-frying/)
        USB-C PD (power delivery) [compliant](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/04/the-not-quite-usb-c-of-nintendo-switch-accessories/);
        its "M92T36 Power Delivery chip [is] the part that most frequently burns out after use of third-party charging equipment"; 
        not sure about USB-PD chargers and the _Lite_, though
    


#### Haptic issues:

- minus-button "-" uncomfortable to reach and press
- hand cramps (adult hands) after some time playing, buying (large) extra grips required
- fear of scratching the screen, buying separate screen protector (tempered glas) required
    - avoid weak Thesa for the "hinge" installation method (gets loose when you peel off the glas foil)



#### Software Issues:

- slow lagging eshop on switch device
    - [made with React](https://html5experts-jp.translate.goog/shumpei-shiraishi/24538/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en) 
        in WebKit browser _without_ JIT compiler (because of traditional WebKit exploits [abusing JIT memory](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1905.07643/) which is writable and executable by design)
	- small pagination steps, every time new request to server (devs usually try to avoid expensive I/O): 
	  either bad choice or perhaps sth complex as real-time bidding for single online-ads
	- apparently stressed servers (website in browser on desktop-pc sometimes HTTP 500 error)
        - noticed lot of hotlinking (Dekudeals for example)
	- [dekudeals.com](dekudeals.com) often recommended if you want to browse and be made aware of nice deals (supports Germany too)
    - [delisted games](https://delistedgames.com/all-delisted-nintendo-switch-games/)
- font sizes not optimized in many games, very small, not "responsive" or configurable 
- software-update is mandatory for physical game if you previously installed a digital version in higher version, 
  you cannot skip this; deleting game and save-games won't help, 
  you would have to do a refactory-reset on the switch as described on web/youtube just to play unpatched cartridge without Internet
- "Need for speed HP" payed, installed, tried "Autolog" servers (no longer avail?), 
  dialog "share Nintendo account info with EA (email, birthdate, ...), [cancel], error-loop autolog/privacy-dialog
    - requires to disable WIFI (airplane mode) before starting the game, so it won't try or cannot connect Autolog servers for another reason
- wishlist-additions on the international Nintendo.com will not be displayed correctly on the german Nintendo.de wishlist
  (sync between device and nintendo.de works and vice versa (at least removal of games)) 
- game groups in the user UI should be accessible from home menu



#### Other Issues:

- high games prices (on every platform), but often good deals in eshop
	- is the device itself a losing proposition for Nintendo? 
	  and the money will then be earned from the ecosystem 
	  after users have invested in the platform and are on the hook?
- you can't move SD cards across devices (encrypted)
   = you can't backup downloaded eshop games and save data in case of a device replacement; 
    save data can be backed up by paying Nintendo Switch Online;
    eshop games have to be downloaded again;
    also prevents cheating by editing savegames
- retail cartridge with "internet download required" (Wolfenstein2)
  due to Nintendo's proprietary expensive cartridge hardware with small capacity (16 GB, 32 GB) 
  vs huge filesizes for AAA titles, future?
    - Nintendo wants to keep the retail collector scene alive and 
      have as few vulnerable mechanical parts in their portable device as possible; 
      controller+pins allows to sell at lower competitive price (by _delaying_ costs to cartridge seller) 
      vs having UMD/minidisc reader in every device (and cheap disc production)
- Nintendo support:
	- quick response but useless so far
	- could not write replies to info@nintendo.de (SMTP error, very generous IP block?)
	- support ticket links in answers lead to HTTP-404-pages
- eshop downloads take long (3-4 hours for Gigabytes-Titles)
- Nintendo-banned/locked Switch devices on ebay (due to hacking/rooting attempts; similar to Sony/Microsoft)
- investment (system, accessories, games) on top of questionable hardware may lead to invest in additional spare parts (mechanical parts above all):
    - joysticks, fan, battery (55-75 EUR)
    - maybe you're better off with a second Switch Lite with the other becoming the donor board for the second as soon as it dies
        = 2 devices + spare parts



## Gaming in General

### Good

- "Video gaming may be associated with better cognitive performance in children"


### Issues

- "post-game depression"
    - "tragic desire for wholesale immersion in the fiction": 
        player lives vicariously through what he sees on screen, shares drama, feels emotions of characters, 
        realizes what he doesn't have post-game
    - replay in different way
    - cut it short quickly by starting another game even if it feels like a chore:
        "follow emotionally draining games with flow-inducing gameplay driven games" such as
        "Mario Kart/Animal Crossing/Smash/Tetris [...] just 15-30 minute blasts of fun"
    - game-debriefs, detailed analyzes on YouTube or in podcasts
    - game-subreddits with similarly attached people
    - fan-fiction
    - some players omit something, e.g. pause forever before the final boss to give themselves the illusion that the world doesn't stop existing;
        many games are the long way and not just the 2 minute end-sequence
- "video game addiction" 
    - more likely to affect people who are generally prone to chemical or behavioral addictions 
        (alcohol, tobacco, stress-associated eating, working, shopping, exercising, ...)
- "dark patterns"
    - loot boxes, gambling
- "console wars tribalism", "PS5 elitism", "gaming toxity", brand loyalty
    - family-friendly Nintendo, edgy Sega had 'blood', Sony, Microsoft, ... (PC vs Mac), Super Mario vs Sonic
    - defined a generation of child gamers (1990s) through tribalism and exclusives
    - "review bombing"
    - "ended 2010", cross-platform, gamers own multiple consoles, Nintendo niche, PC gaming master race
- "video games cause violence"
    - "appeal of violent video games to lower educated aggressive adolescent boys"
- "waste of time", "no real value or impact in your life"
    - light and dopamine
- "gamer's remorse" (urban dict)



### Misc

- "Gaming study finds adults play more than kids"
- gaming magazines and tv-shows have become Youtube channels and podcasts
- prefer game "review" and "gameplay" videos over game trailers
- Unreal Engine, motion capturing (mocap) etc tutorials on YouTube;
    "atmosphere"/intangibles that can't be put in level editor
- at some time you recognize the same game-engines again and again, just variants of other games
